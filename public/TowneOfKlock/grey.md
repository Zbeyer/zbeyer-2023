# Grey

## The Void.

The void is a vast sea of nothing. The great dragon is rumored to live here.

## White Rooms.

White rooms are places outside the spectrum. A place where light rests. Outsiders are the only ones who have seen these spaces.

## Skybuster Towne.

A city beyond the spectrum used to rip open the sky and watch.
