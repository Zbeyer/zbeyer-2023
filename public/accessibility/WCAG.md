## Abstract

Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 covers a wide range of recommendations for making Web content more accessible. Following these guidelines will make content more accessible to a wider range of people with disabilities, including accommodations for blindness and low vision, deafness and hearing loss, limited movement, speech disabilities, photosensitivity, and combinations of these, and some accommodation for learning disabilities and cognitive limitations; but will not address every user need for people with these disabilities. These guidelines address accessibility of web content on desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. Following these guidelines will also often make Web content more usable to users in general.

WCAG 2.1 success criteria are written as testable statements that are not technology-specific. Guidance about satisfying the success criteria in specific technologies, as well as general information about interpreting the success criteria, is provided in separate documents. See [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) for an introduction and links to WCAG technical and educational material.

WCAG 2.1 extends [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/) [[WCAG20](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#bib-wcag20)], which was published as a W3C Recommendation December 2008. Content that conforms to WCAG 2.1 also conforms to WCAG 2.0. The WG intends that for policies requiring conformance to WCAG 2.0, WCAG 2.1 can provide an alternate means of conformance. The publication of WCAG 2.1 does not deprecate or supersede WCAG 2.0. While WCAG 2.0 remains a W3C Recommendation, the W3C advises the use of WCAG 2.1 to maximize future applicability of accessibility efforts. The W3C also encourages use of the most current version of WCAG when developing or updating Web accessibility policies.

## Status of This Document

## Introduction



*This section is non-normative.*

### Background on WCAG 2



Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 defines how to make Web content more accessible to people with disabilities. Accessibility involves a wide range of disabilities, including visual, auditory, physical, speech, cognitive, language, learning, and neurological disabilities. Although these guidelines cover a wide range of issues, they are not able to address the needs of people with all types, degrees, and combinations of disability. These guidelines also make Web content more usable by older individuals with changing abilities due to aging and often improve usability for users in general.

WCAG 2.1 is developed through the [W3C process](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/w3c-process/) in cooperation with individuals and organizations around the world, with a goal of providing a shared standard for Web content accessibility that meets the needs of individuals, organizations, and governments internationally. WCAG 2.1 builds on WCAG 2.0 [[WCAG20](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#bib-wcag20)], which in turn built on WCAG 1.0 [[WAI-WEBCONTENT](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#bib-wai-webcontent)] and is designed to apply broadly to different Web technologies now and in the future, and to be testable with a combination of automated testing and human evaluation. For an introduction to WCAG, see the [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/).

Significant challenges were encountered in defining additional criteria to address cognitive, language, and learning disabilities, including a short timeline for development as well as challenges in reaching consensus on testability, implementability, and international considerations of proposals. Work will carry on in this area in future versions of WCAG. We encourage authors to refer to our supplemental guidance on [improving inclusion for people with disabilities, including learning and cognitive disabilities, people with low-vision, and more](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/#supplement).

Web accessibility depends not only on accessible content but also on accessible Web browsers and other user agents. Authoring tools also have an important role in Web accessibility. For an overview of how these components of Web development and interaction work together, see:

-   **[Essential Components of Web Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/fundamentals/components/)**
-   **[User Agent Accessibility Guidelines (UAAG) Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/uaag/)**
-   **[Authoring Tool Accessibility Guidelines (ATAG) Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/atag/)**

Where this document refers to WCAG 2 it is intended to mean any and all versions of WCAG that start with 2.

### WCAG 2 Layers of Guidance



The individuals and organizations that use WCAG vary widely and include Web designers and developers, policy makers, purchasing agents, teachers, and students. In order to meet the varying needs of this audience, several layers of guidance are provided including overall *principles*, general *guidelines*, testable *success criteria* and a rich collection of *sufficient techniques*, *advisory techniques*, and *documented common failures* with examples, resource links and code.

-   **Principles** - At the top are four principles that provide the foundation for Web accessibility: *perceivable, operable, understandable, and robust*. See also [Understanding the Four Principles of Accessibility](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/intro#understanding-the-four-principles-of-accessibility).
-   **Guidelines** - Under the principles are guidelines. The 13 guidelines provide the basic goals that authors should work toward in order to make content more accessible to users with different disabilities. The guidelines are not testable, but provide the framework and overall objectives to help authors understand the success criteria and better implement the techniques.
-   **Success Criteria** - For each guideline, testable success criteria are provided to allow WCAG 2.1 to be used where requirements and conformance testing are necessary such as in design specification, purchasing, regulation, and contractual agreements. In order to meet the needs of different groups and different situations, three levels of conformance are defined: A (lowest), AA, and AAA (highest). Additional information on WCAG levels can be found in [Understanding Levels of Conformance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#levels).
-   **Sufficient and Advisory Techniques** - For each of the *guidelines* and *success criteria* in the WCAG 2.1 document itself, the working group has also documented a wide variety of *techniques*. The techniques are informative and fall into two categories: those that are *sufficient* for meeting the success criteria and those that are *advisory*. The advisory techniques go beyond what is required by the individual success criteria and allow authors to better address the guidelines. Some advisory techniques address accessibility barriers that are not covered by the testable success criteria. Where common failures are known, these are also documented. See also [Sufficient and Advisory Techniques in Understanding WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-techniques).

All of these layers of guidance (principles, guidelines, success criteria, and sufficient and advisory techniques) work together to provide guidance on how to make content more accessible. Authors are encouraged to view and apply all layers that they are able to, including the advisory techniques, in order to best address the needs of the widest possible range of users.

Note that even content that conforms at the highest level (AAA) will not be accessible to individuals with all types, degrees, or combinations of disability, particularly in the cognitive language and learning areas. Authors are encouraged to consider the full range of techniques, including the advisory techniques, as well as to seek relevant advice about current best practice to ensure that Web content is accessible, as far as possible, to this community. [Metadata](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-metadata) may assist users in finding content most suitable for their needs.

### WCAG 2.1 Supporting Documents



The WCAG 2.1 document is designed to meet the needs of those who need a stable, referenceable technical standard. Other documents, called supporting documents, are based on the WCAG 2.1 document and address other important purposes, including the ability to be updated to describe how WCAG would be applied with new technologies. Supporting documents include:

1.  **[How to Meet WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/)** - A customizable quick reference to WCAG 2.1 that includes all of the guidelines, success criteria, and techniques for authors to use as they are developing and evaluating Web content. This includes content from WCAG 2.0 and WCAG 2.1 and can be filtered in many ways to help authors focus on relevant content.
2.  **[Understanding WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/)** - A guide to understanding and implementing WCAG 2.1. There is a short "Understanding" document for each guideline and success criterion in WCAG 2.1 as well as key topics.
3.  **[Techniques for WCAG 2.1](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Techniques/)** - A collection of techniques and common failures, each in a separate document that includes a description, examples, code and tests.
4.  **[The WCAG Documents](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/docs/)** - A diagram and description of how the technical documents are related and linked.

See [Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) Overview](https://www.w3.org/WAI/standards-guidelines/wcag/) for a description of the WCAG 2.1 supporting material, including education resources related to WCAG 2. Additional resources covering topics such as the business case for Web accessibility, planning implementation to improve the accessibility of Web sites, and accessibility policies are listed in [WAI Resources](https://www.w3.org/WAI/Resources/Overview).

### Requirements for WCAG 2.1



WCAG 2.1 meets a set of [requirements for WCAG 2.1](https://w3c.github.io/wcag21/requirements/) which, in turn, inherit requirements from WCAG 2.0. Requirements structure the overall framework of guidelines and ensure backwards compatibility. The Working Group also used a less formal set of acceptance criteria for success criteria, to help ensure success criteria are similar in style and quality to those in WCAG 2.0. These requirements constrained what could be included in WCAG 2.1. This constraint was important to preserve its nature as a dot-release of WCAG 2.

### Comparison with WCAG 2.0



WCAG 2.1 was initiated with the goal to improve accessibility guidance for three major groups: users with cognitive or learning disabilities, users with low vision, and users with disabilities on mobile devices. Many ways to meet these needs were proposed and evaluated, and a set of these were refined by the Working Group. Structural requirements inherited from WCAG 2.0, clarity and impact of proposals, and timeline led to the final set of success criteria included in this version. The Working Group considers that WCAG 2.1 incrementally advances web content accessibility guidance for all these areas, but underscores that not all user needs are met by these guidelines.

WCAG 2.1 builds on and is backwards compatible with WCAG 2.0, meaning web pages that conform to WCAG 2.1 also conform to WCAG 2.0. Authors that are required by policy to conform with WCAG 2.0 will be able to update content to WCAG 2.1 without losing conformance with WCAG 2.0. Authors following both sets of guidelines should be aware of the following differences:

#### New Features in WCAG 2.1



WCAG 2.1 extends WCAG 2.0 by adding new success criteria, definitions to support them, guidelines to organize the additions, and a couple additions to the conformance section. This additive approach helps to make it clear that sites which conform to WCAG 2.1 also conform to WCAG 2.0, thereby meeting conformance obligations that are specific to WCAG 2.0. The Accessibility Guidelines Working Group recommends that sites adopt WCAG 2.1 as their new conformance target, even if formal obligations mention WCAG 2.0, to provide improved accessibility and to anticipate future policy changes.

The following Success Criteria are new in WCAG 2.1:

-   1.3.4 [Orientation](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#orientation) (AA)
-   1.3.5 [Identify Input Purpose](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#identify-input-purpose) (AA)
-   1.3.6 [Identify Purpose](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#identify-purpose) (AAA)
-   1.4.10 [Reflow](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#reflow) (AA)
-   1.4.11 [Non-Text Contrast](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#non-text-contrast) (AA)
-   1.4.12 [Text Spacing](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#text-spacing) (AA)
-   1.4.13 [Content on Hover or Focus](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#content-on-hover-or-focus) (AA)
-   2.1.4 [Character Key Shortcuts](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#character-key-shortcuts) (A)
-   2.2.6 [Timeouts](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#timeouts) (AAA)
-   2.3.3 [Animation from Interactions](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#animation-from-interactions) (AAA)
-   2.5.1 [Pointer Gestures](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#pointer-gestures) (A)
-   2.5.2 [Pointer Cancellation](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#pointer-cancellation) (A)
-   2.5.3 [Label in Name](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#label-in-name) (A)
-   2.5.4 [Motion Actuation](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#motion-actuation) (A)
-   2.5.5 [Target Size](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#target-size) (AAA)
-   2.5.6 [Concurrent Input Mechanisms](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#concurrent-input-mechanisms) (AAA)
-   4.1.3 [Status Messages](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#status-messages) (AA)

The new success criteria may reference new terms that have also been added to the glossary and form part of the normative requirements of the success criteria.

In the Conformance section, a third note about page variants has been added to [Full Pages](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#cc2), and an option for machine-readable metadata added to [Optional Components of a Conformance Claim](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#conformance-optional).

#### Numbering in WCAG 2.1



In order to avoid confusion for implementers for whom backwards compatibility to WCAG 2.0 is important, new success criteria in WCAG 2.1 have been appended to the end of the set of success criteria within their guideline. This avoids the need to change the section number of success criteria from WCAG 2.0, which would be caused by inserting new success criteria between existing success criteria in the guideline, but it means success criteria in each guideline are no longer grouped by conformance level. The order of success criteria within each guideline does not imply information about conformance level; only the conformance level indicator (A / AA / AAA) on the success criterion itself indicates this. The [WCAG 2.1 Quick Reference](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/) provides ways to view success criteria grouped by conformance level, along with many other filter and sort options.

#### Conformance to WCAG 2.1



WCAG 2.1 uses the same conformance model as WCAG 2.0 with a couple additions, which is described in the [Conformance](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#conformance) section. It is intended that sites that conform to WCAG 2.1 also conform to WCAG 2.0, which means they meet the requirements of any policies that reference WCAG 2.0, while also better meeting the needs of users on the current Web.

### Later Versions of Accessibility Guidelines



In parallel with WCAG 2.1, the Accessibility Guidelines Working Group is developing another major version of accessibility guidelines. The result of this work is expected to be a more substantial restructuring of web accessibility guidance than would be realistic for dot-releases of WCAG 2. The work follows a research-focused, user-centered design methodology to produce the most effective and flexible outcome, including the roles of content authoring, user agent support, and authoring tool support. This is a multi-year effort, so WCAG 2.1 is needed as an interim measure to provide updated web accessibility guidance to reflect changes on the web since the publication of WCAG 2.0. The Working Group might also develop additional interim versions, continuing with WCAG 2.2, on a similar short timeline to provide additional support while the major version is completed.

## 1. Perceivable



Information and user interface components must be presentable to users in ways they can perceive.

    A [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-mechanism) is available to dismiss the additional content without moving pointer hover or keyboard focus, unless the additional content communicates an [input error](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-input-error) or does not obscure or replace other content;

-   Hoverable

    If pointer hover can trigger the additional content, then the pointer can be moved over the additional content without the additional content disappearing;

-   Persistent

    The additional content remains visible until the hover or focus trigger is removed, the user dismisses it, or its information is no longer valid.

Exception: The visual presentation of the additional content is controlled by the user agent and is not modified by the author.

NOTE

Examples of additional content controlled by the user agent include browser tooltips created through use of the HTML [`title` attribute](https://www.w3.org/TR/html/dom.html#the-title-attribute).

NOTE

Custom tooltips, sub-menus, and other nonmodal popups that display on hover and focus are examples of additional content covered by this criterion.

#### Success Criterion 2.1.1 Keyboard



[Understanding Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/keyboard.html)|
[How to Meet Keyboard](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#keyboard)

(Level A)

All [functionality](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-functionality) of the content is operable through a [keyboard interface](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-keyboard-interface) without requiring specific timings for individual keystrokes, except where the underlying function requires input that depends on the path of the user's movement and not just the endpoints.

NOTE

This exception relates to the underlying function, not the input technique. For example, if using handwriting to enter text, the input technique (handwriting) requires path-dependent input but the underlying function (text input) does not.

NOTE

This does not forbid and should not discourage providing mouse input or other input methods in addition to keyboard operation.

#### Success Criterion 2.1.2 No Keyboard Trap



[Understanding No Keyboard Trap](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/no-keyboard-trap.html)|

-   Real-time Exception

    The time limit is a required part of a real-time event (for example, an auction), and no alternative to the time limit is possible; or

-   Essential Exception

    The time limit is [essential](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-essential) and extending it would invalidate the activity; or

-   20 Hour Exception

    The time limit is longer than 20 hours.

NOTE

This success criterion helps ensure that users can complete tasks without unexpected changes in content or context that are a result of a time limit. This success criterion should be considered in conjunction with [Success Criterion 3.2.1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#on-focus), which puts limits on changes of content or context as a result of user action.

-   Moving, blinking, scrolling

    For any moving, blinking or scrolling information that (1) starts automatically, (2) lasts more than five seconds, and (3) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to [pause](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-pause), stop, or hide it unless the movement, blinking, or scrolling is part of an activity where it is [essential](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-essential); and

-   Auto-updating

    For any auto-updating information that (1) starts automatically and (2) is presented in parallel with other content, there is a mechanism for the user to pause, stop, or hide it or to control the frequency of the update unless the auto-updating is part of an activity where it is essential.

NOTE

For requirements related to flickering or flashing content, refer to [Guideline 2.3](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#seizures-and-physical-reactions).

NOTE

Since any content that does not meet this success criterion can interfere with a user's ability to use the whole page, all content on the Web page (whether it is used to meet other success criteria or not) must meet this success criterion. See [Conformance Requirement 5: Non-Interference](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#cc5).

NOTE

Content that is updated periodically by software or that is streamed to the user agent is not required to preserve or present information that is generated or received between the initiation of the pause and resuming presentation, as this may not be technically possible, and in many situations could be misleading to do so.

NOTE

An animation that occurs as part of a preload phase or similar situation can be considered essential if interaction cannot occur during that phase for all users and if not indicating progress could confuse users or cause them to think that content was frozen or broken.

#### Success Criterion 2.2.3 No Timing

[Understanding Parsing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/parsing.html)|
[How to Meet Parsing](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/quickref/#parsing)

(Level A)

In content implemented using markup languages, elements have complete start and end tags, elements are nested according to their specifications, elements do not contain duplicate attributes, and any IDs are unique, except where the specifications allow these features.

NOTE

This Success Criterion should be considered as always satisfied for any content using HTML or XML.

NOTE

Since this criterion was written, the HTML Living Standard has adopted specific requirements governing how user agents must handle incomplete tags, incorrect element nesting, duplicate attributes, and non-unique IDs. [[HTML](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#bib-html)]

Although the HTML Standard treats some of these cases as non-conforming for authors, it is considered to "allow these features" for the purposes of this Success Criterion because the specification requires that user agents support handling these cases consistently. In practice, this criterion no longer provides any benefit to people with disabilities in itself.

Issues such as missing roles due to inappropriately nested elements or incorrect states or names due to a duplicate ID are covered by different Success Criteria and should be reported under those criteria rather than as issues with 4.1.1.

## 5. Conformance



This section lists requirements for [conformance](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-conform) to WCAG 2.1. It also gives information about how to make conformance claims, which are optional. Finally, it describes what it means to be [accessibility supported](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-accessibility-supported), since only accessibility-supported ways of using technologies can be [relied upon](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-relied-upon) for conformance. [Understanding Conformance](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance) includes further explanation of the accessibility-supported concept.

### 5.1 Interpreting Normative Requirements



The main content of WCAG 2.1 is [normative](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-normative) and defines requirements that impact conformance claims. Introductory material, appendices, sections marked as "non-normative", diagrams, examples, and notes are [informative](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-informative) (non-normative). Non-normative material provides advisory information to help interpret the guidelines but does not create requirements that impact a conformance claim.

The key words *MAY*, *MUST*, *MUST NOT*, *NOT RECOMMENDED*, *RECOMMENDED*, *SHOULD*, and *SHOULD NOT* are to be interpreted as described in [[RFC2119](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#bib-rfc2119)].

### 5.2 Conformance Requirements



In order for a Web page to conform to WCAG 2.1, all of the following conformance requirements must be satisfied:

#### 5.2.1 Conformance Level



One of the following levels of conformance is met in full.

-   For Level A conformance (the minimum level of conformance), the [Web page](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-web-page-s) [satisfies](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-satisfies) all the Level A Success Criteria, or a [conforming alternate version](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-conforming-alternate-versions) is provided.
-   For Level AA conformance, the Web page satisfies all the Level A and Level AA Success Criteria, or a Level AA conforming alternate version is provided.
-   For Level AAA conformance, the Web page satisfies all the Level A, Level AA and Level AAA Success Criteria, or a Level AAA conforming alternate version is provided.

NOTE

Although conformance can only be achieved at the stated levels, authors are encouraged to report (in their claim) any progress toward meeting success criteria from all levels beyond the achieved level of conformance.

NOTE

It is not recommended that Level AAA conformance be required as a general policy for entire sites because it is not possible to satisfy all Level AAA Success Criteria for some content.

#### 5.2.2 Full pages



[Conformance](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-conform) (and conformance level) is for full [Web page(s)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-web-page-s) only, and cannot be achieved if part of a Web page is excluded.

NOTE

For the purpose of determining conformance, alternatives to part of a page's content are considered part of the page when the alternatives can be obtained directly from the page, e.g., a long description or an alternative presentation of a video.

NOTE

Authors of Web pages that cannot conform due to content outside of the author's control may consider a [Statement of Partial Conformance](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#conformance-partial).

NOTE

A full page includes each variation of the page that is automatically presented by the page for various screen sizes (e.g. variations in a responsive Web page). Each of these variations needs to conform (or needs to have a conforming alternate version) in order for the entire page to conform.

#### 5.2.3 Complete processes



When a [Web page](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-web-page-s) is one of a series of Web pages presenting a [process](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-processes) (i.e., a sequence of steps that need to be completed in order to accomplish an activity), all Web pages in the process conform at the specified level or better. (Conformance is not possible at a particular level if any page in the process does not conform at that level or better.)

An online store has a series of pages that are used to select and purchase products. All pages in the series from start to finish (checkout) conform in order for any page that is part of the process to conform.

#### 5.2.4 Only Accessibility-Supported Ways of Using Technologies



Only [accessibility-supported](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-accessibility-supported) ways of using [technologies](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-technologies) are [relied upon](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-relied-upon) to satisfy the success criteria. Any information or functionality that is provided in a way that is not accessibility supported is also available in a way that is accessibility supported. (See [Understanding accessibility support](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#accessibility-support).)

#### 5.2.5 Non-Interference



If [technologies ](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-technologies)are used in a way that is not [accessibility supported](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-accessibility-supported), or if they are used in a non-conforming way, then they do not block the ability of users to access the rest of the page. In addition, the [Web page](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-web-page-s) as a whole continues to meet the conformance requirements under each of the following conditions:

1.  when any technology that is not [relied upon](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-relied-upon) is turned on in a user agent,
2.  when any technology that is not relied upon is turned off in a user agent, and
3.  when any technology that is not relied upon is not supported by a user agent

In addition, the following success criteria apply to all content on the page, including content that is not otherwise relied upon to meet conformance, because failure to meet them could interfere with any use of the page:

-   **1.4.2 - Audio Control**,
-   **2.1.2 - No Keyboard Trap**,
-   **2.3.1 - Three Flashes or Below Threshold**, and
-   **2.2.2 - Pause, Stop, Hide**.

NOTE

If a page cannot conform (for example, a conformance test page or an example page), it cannot be included in the scope of conformance or in a conformance claim.

For more information, including examples, see [Understanding Conformance Requirements](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#conformance-requirements).

### 5.3 Conformance Claims (Optional)



Conformance is defined only for [Web pages](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-web-page-s). However, a conformance claim may be made to cover one page, a series of pages, or multiple related Web pages.

#### 5.3.1 Required Components of a Conformance Claim



Conformance claims are **not required**. Authors can conform to WCAG 2.1 without making a claim. However, if a conformance claim is made, then the conformance claim **must** include the following information:

1.  **Date** of the claim

2.  **Guidelines title, version and URI** "Web Content Accessibility Guidelines 2.1 at https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/"

3.  **Conformance level** satisfied: (Level A, AA or AAA)

4.  **A concise description of the Web pages**, such as a list of URIs for which the claim is made, including whether subdomains are included in the claim.

    NOTE

    The Web pages may be described by list or by an expression that describes all of the URIs included in the claim.

    NOTE

    Web-based products that do not have a URI prior to installation on the customer's Web site may have a statement that the product would conform when installed.

5.  A list of the **[Web content technologies](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-technologies) [relied upon](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-relied-upon)**.

NOTE

If a conformance logo is used, it would constitute a claim and must be accompanied by the required components of a conformance claim listed above.

#### 5.3.2 Optional Components of a Conformance Claim



In addition to the required components of a conformance claim above, consider providing additional information to assist users. Recommended additional information includes:

-   A list of success criteria beyond the level of conformance claimed that have been met. This information should be provided in a form that users can use, preferably machine-readable metadata.
-   A list of the specific technologies that are " *used but not [relied upon](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-relied-upon)*."
-   A list of user agents, including assistive technologies that were used to test the content.
-   A list of specific accessibility characteristics of the content, provided in machine-readable metadata.
-   Information about any additional steps taken that go beyond the success criteria to enhance accessibility.
-   A machine-readable metadata version of the list of specific technologies that are [relied upon](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-relied-upon).
-   A machine-readable metadata version of the conformance claim.

NOTE

Refer to [Understanding Conformance Claims](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#conformance-claims) for more information and example conformance claims.

NOTE

Refer to [Understanding Metadata](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/understanding-metadata) for more information about the use of metadata in conformance claims.

### 5.4 Statement of Partial Conformance - Third Party Content



Sometimes, Web pages are created that will later have additional content added to them. For example, an email program, a blog, an article that allows users to add comments, or applications supporting user-contributed content. Another example would be a page, such as a portal or news site, composed of content aggregated from multiple contributors, or sites that automatically insert content from other sources over time, such as when advertisements are inserted dynamically.

In these cases, it is not possible to know at the time of original posting what the uncontrolled content of the pages will be. It is important to note that the uncontrolled content can affect the accessibility of the controlled content as well. Two options are available:

1.  A determination of conformance can be made based on best knowledge. If a page of this type is monitored and repaired (non-conforming content is removed or brought into conformance) within two business days, then a determination or claim of conformance can be made since, except for errors in externally contributed content which are corrected or removed when encountered, the page conforms. No conformance claim can be made if it is not possible to monitor or correct non-conforming content;

    **OR**

2.  A "statement of partial conformance" may be made that the page does not conform, but could conform if certain parts were removed. The form of that statement would be, "This page does not conform, but would conform to WCAG 2.1 at level X if the following parts from uncontrolled sources were removed." In addition, the following would also be true of uncontrolled content that is described in the statement of partial conformance:

    1.  It is not content that is under the author's control.
    2.  It is described in a way that users can identify (e.g., they cannot be described as "all parts that we do not control" unless they are clearly marked as such.)

### 5.5 Statement of Partial Conformance - Language



A "statement of partial conformance due to language" may be made when the page does not conform, but would conform if [accessibility support](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-accessibility-supported) existed for (all of) the language(s) used on the page. The form of that statement would be, "This page does not conform, but would conform to WCAG 2.1 at level X if accessibility support existed for the following language(s):"

## 6. Glossary



-   abbreviation

    shortened form of a word, phrase, or name where the abbreviation has not become part of the languageNOTEThis includes initialisms and acronyms where:**initialisms** are shortened forms of a name or phrase made from the initial letters of words or syllables contained in that name or phraseNOTENot defined in all languages.[EXAMPLE 1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#example-1)SNCF is a French initialism that contains the initial letters of the Soci√©t√© Nationale des Chemins de Fer, the French national railroad.[EXAMPLE 2](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#example-2)ESP is an initialism for extrasensory perception.**acronyms** are abbreviated forms made from the initial letters or parts of other words (in a name or phrase) which may be pronounced as a word[EXAMPLE 3](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#example-3)NOAA is an acronym made from the initial letters of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the United States.NOTESome companies have adopted what used to be an initialism as their company name. In these cases, the new name of the company is the letters (for example, Ecma) and the word is no longer considered an abbreviation.

-   accessibility supported

    supported by users' [assistive technologies](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-assistive-technologies) as well as the accessibility features in browsers and other [user agents](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-user-agents)To qualify as an accessibility-supported use of a Web content technology (or feature of a technology), both 1 and 2 must be satisfied for a Web content technology (or feature):**The way that the [Web content technology](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-technologies) is used must be supported by users' assistive technology (AT).** This means that the way that the technology is used has been tested for interoperability with users' assistive technology in the [human language(s)](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-human-language-s) of the content,**AND****The Web content technology must have accessibility-supported user agents that are available to users.** This means that at least one of the following four statements is true:The technology is supported natively in widely-distributed user agents that are also accessibility supported (such as HTML and CSS);**OR**The technology is supported in a widely-distributed plug-in that is also accessibility supported;**OR**The content is available in a closed environment, such as a university or corporate network, where the user agent required by the technology and used by the organization is also accessibility supported;**OR**The user agent(s) that support the technology are accessibility supported and are available for download or purchase in a way that:does not cost a person with a disability any more than a person without a disability **and**is as easy to find and obtain for a person with a disability as it is for a person without disabilities.NOTEThe Accessibility Guidelines Working Group and the W3C do not specify which or how much support by assistive technologies there must be for a particular use of a Web technology in order for it to be classified as accessibility supported. (See [Level of Assistive Technology Support Needed for "Accessibility Support"](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#support-level).)NOTEWeb technologies can be used in ways that are not accessibility supported as long as they are not [relied upon](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-relied-upon) and the page as a whole meets the conformance requirements, including [Conformance Requirement 4](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#cc4) and [Conformance Requirement 5](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#cc5).NOTEWhen a [Web Technology](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-technologies) is used in a way that is "accessibility supported," it does not imply that the entire technology or all uses of the technology are supported. Most technologies, including HTML, lack support for at least one feature or use. Pages conform to WCAG only if the uses of the technology that are accessibility supported can be relied upon to meet WCAG requirements.NOTEWhen citing Web content technologies that have multiple versions, the version(s) supported should be specified.NOTEOne way for authors to locate uses of a technology that are accessibility supported would be to consult compilations of uses that are documented to be accessibility supported. (See [Understanding Accessibility-Supported Web Technology Uses](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#documented-lists).) Authors, companies, technology vendors, or others may document accessibility-supported ways of using Web content technologies. However, all ways of using technologies in the documentation would need to meet the definition of accessibility-supported Web content technologies above.

-   alternative for time-based media

    document including correctly sequenced text descriptions of time-based visual and auditory information and providing a means for achieving the outcomes of any time-based interactionNOTEA screenplay used to create the synchronized media content would meet this definition only if it was corrected to accurately represent the final synchronized media after editing.

-   ambiguous to users in general

    the purpose cannot be determined from the link and all information of the Web page presented to the user simultaneously with the link (i.e., readers without disabilities would not know what a link would do until they activated it)[EXAMPLE 4](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#example-4)The word guava in the following sentence "One of the notable exports is guava" is a link. The link could lead to a definition of guava, a chart listing the quantity of guava exported or a photograph of people harvesting guava. Until the link is activated, all readers are unsure and the person with a disability is not at any disadvantage.

-   ASCII art

    picture created by a spatial arrangement of characters or glyphs (typically from the 95 printable characters defined by ASCII)

-   assistive technology (as used in this document)

    hardware and/or software that acts as a [user agent](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-user-agents), or along with a mainstream user agent, to provide functionality to meet the requirements of users with disabilities that go beyond those offered by mainstream user agentsNOTEfunctionality provided by assistive technology includes alternative presentations (e.g., as synthesized speech or magnified content), alternative input methods (e.g., voice), additional navigation or orientation mechanisms, and content transformations (e.g., to make tables more accessible).NOTEAssistive technologies often communicate data and messages with mainstream user agents by using and monitoring APIs.NOTEThe distinction between mainstream user agents and assistive technologies is not absolute. Many mainstream user agents provide some features to assist individuals with disabilities. The basic difference is that mainstream user agents target broad and diverse audiences that usually include people with and without disabilities. Assistive technologies target narrowly defined populations of users with specific disabilities. The assistance provided by an assistive technology is more specific and appropriate to the needs of its target users. The mainstream user agent may provide important functionality to assistive technologies like retrieving Web content from program objects or parsing markup into identifiable bundles.[EXAMPLE 5](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#example-5)Assistive technologies that are important in the context of this document include the following:screen magnifiers, and other visual reading assistants, which are used by people with visual, perceptual and physical print disabilities to change text font, size, spacing, color, synchronization with speech, etc. in order to improve the visual readability of rendered text and images;screen readers, which are used by people who are blind to read textual information through synthesized speech or braille;text-to-speech software, which is used by some people with cognitive, language, and learning disabilities to convert text into synthetic speech;speech recognition software, which may be used by people who have some physical disabilities;alternative keyboards, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities to simulate the keyboard (including alternate keyboards that use head pointers, single switches, sip/puff and other special input devices.);alternative pointing devices, which are used by people with certain physical disabilities to simulate mouse pointing and button activations.

-   audio

    the technology of sound reproductionNOTEAudio can be created synthetically (including speech synthesis), recorded from real world sounds, or both.

-   audio description

    narration added to the soundtrack to describe important visual details that cannot be understood from the main soundtrack aloneNOTEAudio description of [video](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-video) provides information about actions, characters, scene changes, on-screen text, and other visual content.NOTEIn standard audio description, narration is added during existing pauses in dialogue. (See also [extended audio description](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-extended-audio-description).)NOTEWhere all of the [video](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-video) information is already provided in existing [audio](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-audio), no additional audio description is necessary.NOTEAlso called "video description" and "descriptive narration."

-   audio-only

    a time-based presentation that contains only [audio](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-audio) (no [video](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-video) and no interaction)

-   blinking

    switch back and forth between two visual states in a way that is meant to draw attentionNOTESee also [flash](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-flashes). It is possible for something to be large enough and blink brightly enough at the right frequency to be also classified as a flash.

-   blocks of text

    more than one sentence of text

-   CAPTCHA

    initialism for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart"NOTECAPTCHA tests often involve asking the user to type in text that is displayed in an obscured image or audio file.NOTEA Turing test is any system of tests designed to differentiate a human from a computer. It is named after famed computer scientist Alan Turing. The term was coined by researchers at Carnegie Mellon University.

-   captions

    synchronized visual and/or [text alternative](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-text-alternative) for both speech and non-speech audio information needed to understand the media contentNOTECaptions are similar to dialogue-only subtitles except captions convey not only the content of spoken dialogue, but also equivalents for non-dialogue audio information needed to understand the program content, including sound effects, music, laughter, speaker identification and location.NOTEClosed Captions are equivalents that can be turned on and off with some players.NOTEOpen Captions are any captions that cannot be turned off. For example, if the captions are visual equivalent [images of text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-images-of-text) embedded in [video](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-video).NOTECaptions should not obscure or obstruct relevant information in the video.NOTEIn some countries, captions are called subtitles.NOTE[Audio descriptions](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-audio-descriptions) can be, but do not need to be, captioned since they are descriptions of information that is already presented visually.

-   changes of context

    major changes that, if made without user awareness, can disorient users who are not able to view the entire page simultaneouslyChanges in context include changes of:[user agent](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-user-agents);[viewport](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-viewport);focus;[content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-content) that changes the meaning of the [Web page](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-web-page-s)NOTEA change of content is not always a change of context. Changes in content, such as an expanding outline, dynamic menu, or a tab control do not necessarily change the context, unless they also change one of the above (e.g., focus).[EXAMPLE 6](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#example-6)Opening a new window, moving focus to a different component, going to a new page (including anything that would look to a user as if they had moved to a new page) or significantly re-arranging the content of a page are examples of changes of context.

-   conformance

    satisfying all the requirements of a given standard, guideline or specification

-   conforming alternate version

    version thatconforms at the designated level, andprovides all of the same information and [functionality](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-functionality) in the same [human language](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-human-language-s), andis as up to date as the non-conforming content, andfor which at least one of the following is true:the conforming version can be reached from the non-conforming page via an [accessibility-supported](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-accessibility-supported) [mechanism](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-mechanism), orthe non-conforming version can only be reached from the conforming version, orthe non-conforming version can only be reached from a conforming page that also provides a mechanism to reach the conforming versionNOTEIn this definition, "can only be reached" means that there is some mechanism, such as a conditional redirect, that prevents a user from "reaching" (loading) the non-conforming page unless the user had just come from the conforming version.NOTEThe alternate version does not need to be matched page for page with the original (e.g., the conforming alternate version may consist of multiple pages).NOTEIf multiple language versions are available, then conforming alternate versions are required for each language offered.NOTEAlternate versions may be provided to accommodate different technology environments or user groups. Each version should be as conformant as possible. One version would need to be fully conformant in order to meet [conformance requirement 1](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#cc1).NOTEThe conforming alternative version does not need to reside within the scope of conformance, or even on the same Web site, as long as it is as freely available as the non-conforming version.NOTEAlternate versions should not be confused with [supplementary content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-supplementary-content), which support the original page and enhance comprehension.NOTESetting user preferences within the content to produce a conforming version is an acceptable mechanism for reaching another version as long as the method used to set the preferences is accessibility supported.See [Understanding Conforming Alternate Versions](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#conforming-alt-versions)

-   content (Web content)

    information and sensory experience to be communicated to the user by means of a [user agent](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-user-agents), including code or markup that defines the content's [structure](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-structure), [presentation](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-presentation), and interactions

-   context-sensitive help

    help text that provides information related to the function currently being performedNOTEClear labels can act as context-sensitive help.

-   contrast ratio

    (L1 + 0.05) / (L2 + 0.05), whereL1 is the [relative luminance](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-relative-luminance) of the lighter of the colors, andL2 is the [relative luminance](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-relative-luminance) of the darker of the colors.NOTEContrast ratios can range from 1 to 21 (commonly written 1:1 to 21:1).NOTEBecause authors do not have control over user settings as to how text is rendered (for example font smoothing or anti-aliasing), the contrast ratio for text can be evaluated with anti-aliasing turned off.NOTEFor the purpose of Success Criteria 1.4.3 and 1.4.6, contrast is measured with respect to the specified background over which the text is rendered in normal usage. If no background color is specified, then white is assumed.NOTEBackground color is the specified color of content over which the text is to be rendered in normal usage. It is a failure if no background color is specified when the text color is specified, because the user's default background color is unknown and cannot be evaluated for sufficient contrast. For the same reason, it is a failure if no text color is specified when a background color is specified.NOTEWhen there is a border around the letter, the border can add contrast and would be used in calculating the contrast between the letter and its background. A narrow border around the letter would be used as the letter. A wide border around the letter that fills in the inner details of the letters acts as a halo and would be considered background.NOTEWCAG conformance should be evaluated for color pairs specified in the content that an author would expect to appear adjacent in typical presentation. Authors need not consider unusual presentations, such as color changes made by the user agent, except where caused by authors' code.

-   correct reading sequence

    any sequence where words and paragraphs are presented in an order that does not change the meaning of the content

-   CSS pixel

    visual angle of about 0.0213 degreesA CSS pixel is the canonical unit of measure for all lengths and measurements in CSS. This unit is density-independent, and distinct from actual hardware pixels present in a display. User agents and operating systems should ensure that a CSS pixel is set as closely as possible to the [CSS Values and Units Module Level 3 reference pixel](https://www.w3.org/TR/css3-values/#reference-pixel) [[css3-values](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#bib-css3-values)], which takes into account the physical dimensions of the display and the assumed viewing distance (factors that cannot be determined by content authors).

-   extended audio description

    audio description that is added to an audiovisual presentation by pausing the [video](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-video) so that there is time to add additional descriptionNOTEThis technique is only used when the sense of the [video](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-video) would be lost without the additional [audio description](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-audio-descriptions) and the pauses between dialogue/narration are too short.

-   flash

    a pair of opposing changes in [relative luminance](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-relative-luminance) that can cause seizures in some people if it is large enough and in the right frequency rangeNOTESee [general flash and red flash thresholds](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-general-flash-and-red-flash-thresholds) for information about types of flash that are not allowed.NOTESee also [blinking](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-blinking).

-   general flash and red flash thresholds

    a [flash](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-flashes) or rapidly changing image sequence is below the threshold (i.e., content **passes**) if any of the following are true:there are no more than three **general flashes** and / or no more than three **red flashes** within any one-second period; orthe combined area of flashes occurring concurrently occupies no more than a total of .006 steradians within any 10 degree visual field on the screen (25% of any 10 degree visual field on the screen) at typical viewing distancewhere:A **general flash** is defined as a pair of opposing changes in [relative luminance](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-relative-luminance) of 10% or more of the maximum relative luminance (1.0) where the relative luminance of the darker image is below 0.80; and where "a pair of opposing changes" is an increase followed by a decrease, or a decrease followed by an increase, andA **red flash** is defined as any pair of opposing transitions involving a saturated red*Exception:* Flashing that is a fine, balanced, pattern such as white noise or an alternating checkerboard pattern with "squares" smaller than 0.1 degree (of visual field at typical viewing distance) on a side does not violate the thresholds.NOTEFor general software or Web content, using a 341 x 256 pixel rectangle anywhere on the displayed screen area when the content is viewed at 1024 x 768 pixels will provide a good estimate of a 10 degree visual field for standard screen sizes and viewing distances (e.g., 15-17 inch screen at 22-26 inches). This resolution of 75 - 85 ppi is known to be lower, and thus more conservative than the nominal CSS pixel resolution of 96 ppi in CSS specifications. Higher resolutions displays showing the same rendering of the content yield smaller and safer images so it is lower resolutions that are used to define the thresholds.NOTEA transition is the change in relative luminance (or relative luminance/color for red flashing) between adjacent peaks and valleys in a plot of relative luminance (or relative luminance/color for red flashing) measurement against time. A flash consists of two opposing transitions.NOTEThe working definition (as of 2022) in the field for **"pair of opposing transitions involving a saturated red"** is a pair of opposing transitions where, one transition is either to or from a state with a value R/(R + G + B) that is greater than or equal to 0.8, and the difference between states is more than 0.2 (unitless) in the CIE 1976 UCS chromaticity diagram. [[ISO_9241-391](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#bib-iso_9241-391)]NOTETools are available that will carry out analysis from video screen capture. However, no tool is necessary to evaluate for this condition if flashing is less than or equal to 3 flashes in any one second. Content automatically passes (see #1 and #2 above).

-   human language

    language that is spoken, written or signed (through visual or tactile means) to communicate with humansNOTESee also [sign language](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-sign-language).

-   idiom

    phrase whose meaning cannot be deduced from the meaning of the individual words and the specific words cannot be changed without losing the meaningNOTEidioms cannot be translated directly, word for word, without losing their (cultural or language-dependent) meaning.[EXAMPLE 7](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#example-7)In English, "spilling the beans" means "revealing a secret." However, "knocking over the beans" or "spilling the vegetables" does not mean the same thing.[EXAMPLE 8](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#example-8)In Japanese, the phrase "„Åï„Åò„ÇíÊäï„Åí„Çã" literally translates into "he throws a spoon," but it means that there is nothing he can do and finally he gives up.[EXAMPLE 9](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#example-9)In Dutch, "Hij ging met de kippen op stok" literally translates into "He went to roost with the chickens," but it means that he went to bed early.

-   image of text

    text that has been rendered in a non-text form (e.g., an image) in order to achieve a particular visual effectNOTEThis does not include [text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-text) that is part of a picture that contains significant other visual content.[EXAMPLE 10](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#example-10)A person's name on a nametag in a photograph.

-   informative

    for information purposes and not required for conformanceNOTEContent required for [conformance](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-conform) is referred to as "[normative](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-normative)."

-   input error

    information provided by the user that is not acceptedNOTEThis includes:Information that is required by the [Web page](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-web-page-s) but omitted by the userInformation that is provided by the user but that falls outside the required data format or values

-   jargon

    words used in a particular way by people in a particular field[EXAMPLE 11](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#example-11)The word StickyKeys is jargon from the field of assistive technology/accessibility.

-   keyboard interface

    interface used by software to obtain keystroke inputNOTEA keyboard interface allows users to provide keystroke input to programs even if the native technology does not contain a keyboard.[EXAMPLE 12](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#example-12)A touchscreen PDA has a keyboard interface built into its operating system as well as a connector for external keyboards. Applications on the PDA can use the interface to obtain keyboard input either from an external keyboard or from other applications that provide simulated keyboard output, such as handwriting interpreters or speech-to-text applications with "keyboard emulation" functionality.NOTEOperation of the application (or parts of the application) through a keyboard-operated mouse emulator, such as MouseKeys, does not qualify as operation through a keyboard interface because operation of the program is through its pointing device interface, not through its keyboard interface.

-   keyboard shortcut

    alternative means of triggering an action by the pressing of one or more keys

-   label

    [text](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-text) or other component with a [text alternative](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-text-alternative) that is presented to a user to identify a component within Web [content](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-content)NOTEA label is presented to all users whereas the [name](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-name) may be hidden and only exposed by assistive technology. In many (but not all) cases the name and the label are the same.NOTEThe term label is not limited to the label element in HTML.

-   large scale (text)

    with at least 18 point or 14 point bold or font size that would yield equivalent size for Chinese, Japanese and Korean (CJK) fontsNOTEFonts with extraordinarily thin strokes or unusual features and characteristics that reduce the familiarity of their letter forms are harder to read, especially at lower contrast levels.NOTEFont size is the size when the content is delivered. It does not include resizing that may be done by a user.NOTEThe actual size of the character that a user sees is dependent both on the author-defined size and the user's display or user agent settings. For many mainstream body text fonts, 14 and 18 point is roughly equivalent to 1.2 and 1.5 em or to 120% or 150% of the default size for body text (assuming that the body font is 100%), but authors would need to check this for the particular fonts in use. When fonts are defined in relative units, the actual point size is calculated by the user agent for display. The point size should be obtained from the user agent, or calculated based on font metrics as the user agent does, when evaluating this success criterion. Users who have low vision would be responsible for choosing appropriate settings.NOTEWhen using text without specifying the font size, the smallest font size used on major browsers for unspecified text would be a reasonable size to assume for the font. If a level 1 heading is rendered in 14pt bold or higher on major browsers, then it would be reasonable to assume it is large text. Relative scaling can be calculated from the default sizes in a similar fashion.NOTEThe 18 and 14 point sizes for roman texts are taken from the minimum size for large print (14pt) and the larger standard font size (18pt). For other fonts such as CJK languages, the "equivalent" sizes would be the minimum large print size used for those languages and the next larger standard large print size.

-   legal commitments

    transactions where the person incurs a legally binding obligation or benefit[EXAMPLE 13](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#example-13)A marriage license, a stock trade (financial and legal), a will, a loan, adoption, signing up for the army, a contract of any type, etc.

-   link purpose

    nature of the result obtained by activating a hyperlink

-   live

    information captured from a real-world event and transmitted to the receiver with no more than a broadcast delayNOTEA broadcast delay is a short (usually automated) delay, for example used in order to give the broadcaster time to cue or censor the audio (or video) feed, but not sufficient to allow significant editing.NOTEIf information is completely computer generated, it is not live.

-   lower secondary education level

-   media alternative for text

    media that presents no more information than is already presented in text (directly or via text alternatives)NOTEA media alternative for text is provided for those who benefit from alternate representations of text. Media alternatives for text may be audio-only, video-only (including sign-language video), or audio-video.

-   motion animation

    addition of steps between conditions to create the illusion of movement or to give a sense of a smooth transition[EXAMPLE 14](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#example-14)For example, an element which moves into place or changes size while appearing is considered to be animated. An element which appears instantly without transitioning is not using animation. Motion animation does not include changes of color, blurring, or opacity which do not change the perceived size, shape, or position of the element.

-   name

    text by which software can identify a component within Web content to the userNOTEThe name may be hidden and only exposed by assistive technology, whereas a [label](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-labels) is presented to all users. In many (but not all) cases, the label and the name are the same.NOTEThis is unrelated to the name attribute in HTML.

-   on a full-screen window

    on the most common sized desktop/laptop display with the viewport maximizedNOTESince people generally keep their computers for several years, it is best not to rely on the latest desktop/laptop display resolutions but to consider the common desktop/laptop display resolutions over the course of several years when making this evaluation.

    the relative brightness of any point in a colorspace, normalized to 0 for darkest black and 1 for lightest whiteNOTEFor the sRGB colorspace, the relative luminance of a color is defined as L = 0.2126 * **R** + 0.7152 * **G** + 0.0722 * **B** where **R**, **G** and **B** are defined as:if RsRGB <= 0.04045 then **R** = RsRGB/12.92 else **R** = ((RsRGB+0.055)/1.055) ^ 2.4if GsRGB <= 0.04045 then **G** = GsRGB/12.92 else **G** = ((GsRGB+0.055)/1.055) ^ 2.4if BsRGB <= 0.04045 then **B** = BsRGB/12.92 else **B** = ((BsRGB+0.055)/1.055) ^ 2.4and RsRGB, GsRGB, and BsRGB are defined as:RsRGB = R8bit/255GsRGB = G8bit/255BsRGB = B8bit/255The "^" character is the exponentiation operator. (Formula taken from [[SRGB](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#bib-srgb)].)NOTEBefore May 2021 the value of 0.04045 in the definition was different (0.03928). It was taken from an older version of the specification and has been updated. It has no practical effect on the calculations in the context of these guidelines.NOTEAlmost all systems used today to view Web content assume sRGB encoding. Unless it is known that another color space will be used to process and display the content, authors should evaluate using sRGB colorspace. If using other color spaces, see [Understanding Success Criterion 1.4.3](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/contrast-minimum).NOTEIf dithering occurs after delivery, then the source color value is used. For colors that are dithered at the source, the average values of the colors that are dithered should be used (average R, average G, and average B).NOTETools are available that automatically do the calculations when testing contrast and flash.NOTEA [separate page giving the relative luminance definition using MathML](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/relative-luminance.html) to display the formulas is available.

-   relied upon (technologies that are)

    the content would not [conform](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-conform) if that [technology](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-technologies) is turned off or is not supported

-   role

    text or number by which software can identify the function of a component within Web content[EXAMPLE 24](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#example-24)A number that indicates whether an image functions as a hyperlink, command button, or check box.

-   same functionality

    same result when used[EXAMPLE 25](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#example-25)A submit "search" button on one Web page and a "find" button on another Web page may both have a field to enter a term and list topics in the Web site related to the term submitted. In this case, they would have the same functionality but would not be labeled consistently.

-   same relative order

    same position relative to other itemsNOTEItems are considered to be in the same relative order even if other items are inserted or removed from the original order. For example, expanding navigation menus may insert an additional level of detail or a secondary navigation section may be inserted into the reading order.

-   satisfies a success criterion

    the success criterion does not evaluate to 'false' when applied to the page

-   section

    a self-contained portion of written content that deals with one or more related topics or thoughtsNOTEA section may consist of one or more paragraphs and include graphics, tables, lists and sub-sections.

-   set of web pages

    collection of [web pages](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-web-page-s) that share a common purpose and that are created by the same author, group or organization[EXAMPLE 26](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#example-26)Examples include:a publication which is split across multiple Web pages, where each page contains one chapter or other significant section of the work. The publication is logically a single contiguous unit, and contains navigation features that enable access to the full set of pages.an e-commerce website shows products in a set of Web pages that all share the same navigation and identification. However, when progressing to the checkout process, the template changes; the navigation and other elements are removed, so the pages in that process are functionally and visually different. The checkout pages are not part of the set of product pages.a blog on a sub-domain (e.g. blog.example.com) which has a different navigation and is authored by a distinct set of people from the pages on the primary domain (example.com).NOTEDifferent language versions would be considered different sets of Web pages.

-   sign language

    a language using combinations of movements of the hands and arms, facial expressions, or body positions to convey meaning

-   sign language interpretation

    translation of one language, generally a spoken language, into a [sign language](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-sign-language)NOTETrue sign languages are independent languages that are unrelated to the spoken language(s) of the same country or region.

-   structure

    The way the parts of a [Web page](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-web-page-s) are organized in relation to each other; andThe way a collection of [Web pages](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-web-page-s) is organized

-   style property

    property whose value determines the presentation (e.g. font, color, size, location, padding, volume, synthesized speech prosody) of content elements as they are rendered (e.g. onscreen, via loudspeaker, via braille display) by user agentsStyle properties can have several origins:User agent default styles: The default style property values applied in the absence of any author or user styles. Some web content technologies specify a default rendering, others do not;Author styles: Style property values that are set by the author as part of the content (e.g. in-line styles, author style sheets);User styles: Style property values that are set by the user (e.g. via user agent interface settings, user style sheets)

-   target

    region of the display that will accept a pointer action, such as the interactive area of a user interface componentNOTEIf two or more targets are overlapping, the overlapping area should not be included in the measurement of the target size, except when the overlapping targets perform the same action or open the same page.

Programmatically associated text is text whose location can be programmatically determined from the non-text content.[EXAMPLE 32](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#example-32)An image of a chart is described in text in the paragraph after the chart. The short text alternative for the chart indicates that a description follows.NOTERefer to [Understanding Text Alternatives](https://www.w3.org/WAI/WCAG21/Understanding/conformance#text-alternatives) for more information.

-   up-event

    platform event that occurs when the trigger stimulus of a pointer is releasedThe up-event may have different names on different platforms, such as "touchend" or "mouseup".

-   used in an unusual or restricted way

    words used in such a way that requires users to know exactly which definition to apply in order to understand the content correctly[EXAMPLE 33](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#example-33)The term "gig" means something different if it occurs in a discussion of music concerts than it does in article about computer hard drive space, but the appropriate definition can be determined from context. By contrast, the word "text" is used in a very specific way in WCAG 2.1, so a definition is supplied in the glossary.

-   user agent

-   user interface component

    a part of the content that is perceived by users as a single control for a distinct functionNOTEMultiple user interface components may be implemented as a single programmatic element. "Components" here is not tied to programming techniques, but rather to what the user perceives as separate controls.NOTEUser interface components include form elements and links as well as components generated by scripts.NOTEWhat is meant by "component" or "user interface component" here is also sometimes called "user interface element".[EXAMPLE 36](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#example-36)An applet has a "control" that can be used to move through content by line or page or random access. Since each of these would need to have a name and be settable independently, they would each be a "user interface component."

-   user inactivity

    any continuous period of time where no user actions occurThe method of tracking will be determined by the web site or application.

-   video

    the technology of moving or sequenced pictures or imagesNOTEVideo can be made up of animated or photographic images, or both.

-   video-only

Viewports include windows, frames, loudspeakers, and virtual magnifying glasses. A viewport may contain another viewport (e.g., nested frames). Interface components created by the user agent such as prompts, menus, and alerts are not viewports.NOTEThis definition is based on [User Agent Accessibility Guidelines 1.0 Glossary](https://www.w3.org/TR/WAI-USERAGENT/glossary.html) [[UAAG10](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#bib-uaag10)].

-   visually customized

    the font, size, color, and background can be set

-   Web page

    a non-embedded resource obtained from a single URI using HTTP plus any other resources that are used in the rendering or intended to be rendered together with it by a [user agent](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-user-agents)NOTEAlthough any "other resources" would be rendered together with the primary resource, they would not necessarily be rendered simultaneously with each other.NOTEFor the purposes of conformance with these guidelines, a resource must be "non-embedded" within the scope of conformance to be considered a Web page.[EXAMPLE 37](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#example-37)A Web resource including all embedded images and media.[EXAMPLE 38](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#example-38)A Web mail program built using Asynchronous JavaScript and XML (AJAX). The program lives entirely at http://example.com/mail, but includes an inbox, a contacts area and a calendar. Links or buttons are provided that cause the inbox, contacts, or calendar to display, but do not change the URI of the page as a whole.[EXAMPLE 39](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#example-39)A customizable portal site, where users can choose content to display from a set of different content modules.[EXAMPLE 40](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#example-40)When you enter "http://shopping.example.com/" in your browser, you enter a movie-like interactive shopping environment where you visually move around in a store dragging products off of the shelves around you and into a visual shopping cart in front of you. Clicking on a product causes it to be demonstrated with a specification sheet floating alongside. This might be a single-page Web site or just one page within a Web site.

## 7. Input Purposes for User Interface Components



This section contains a listing of common [user interface component](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG21/#dfn-user-interface-components) input purposes. The terms below are not keywords that must be used, but instead represent purposes that must be captured in the taxonomy adopted by a webpage. Where applicable, authors mark up controls with the chosen taxonomy to indicate the semantic purpose. This provides the potential for user agents and assistive technologies to apply personalized presentations that can enable more people to understand and use the content.

NOTE

The list of input type purposes is based on the control purposes defined in the [HTML 5.2 Autofill field section](https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/sec-forms.html#sec-autofill), but it is important to understand that a different technology may have some or all of the same concepts defined in its specification and only the concepts that are mapped to the meanings below are required.
