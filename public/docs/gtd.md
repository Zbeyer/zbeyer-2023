# Getting Things Done (GTD)

1.   Decide if it's important

Seperate task into **TODO** or information **archives**

2.   Categorize

Determine what bucket of stuff todos fall into (work, family, etc.)

3.   Make Lists

Manage lists of TODO items. Lists are good for getting things done

>   If it's not on a list it doesn't exist.

Do the easy things first to build momentum, but always be time oriented, items with a sooner deadline should be worked on first, for example.
