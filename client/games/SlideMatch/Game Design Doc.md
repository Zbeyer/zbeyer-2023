## Slide Match

Each time the user slides a new item is created

A slide pushes items on the board as far as it can go in the direction of the slide (until it encounters another item that cannot move OR a wall)

If two items of the same type collide they form the next item

Game over when there are no more slides available

Score is determined by items on the board
